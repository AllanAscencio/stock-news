Install requests:

Linux

```
  $ pip install requests 
```

In Linux, If you require root permission, use ‚Äòsudo‚Äô. Alternatively, you can also use pipenv to install requests library, where pipenv is used to automatically manage the packages during the course of installation/uninstallation.

```
$ pip install pipenv
```

Windows

The Windows users need to navigate to the Python directory, and then install the request module as follows:

```
> python -m pip install requests
```

Mac
For MacOS, install Python through ‚ÄòHome Brew‚Äô. Thereafter, install pip and request module (which is the same as Linux installation process.)

Install twilio:

The easiest way to install the library is from PyPi using pip, a package manager for Python. Simply run this in a terminal:

```
pip3 install twilio
```
If you get a pip: command not found error, you can also use easy_install. Run this in your terminal:

```
easy_install twilio
```
Manual twilio installation

Alternatively, you can download the source code (ZIP) for twilio-python https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python/zipball/main, and then install the library by running: 
```
python3 setup.py install
```
in the folder containing the twilio-python library.

‚ÄúPermission Denied‚Äù
If the command line gives you a big long error message that says Permission Denied in the middle of it, try running the above commands with sudo (e.g., sudo pip3 install twilio).

### Test your installation

Try sending yourself an SMS message. Save the following code sample to your computer with a text editor. Be sure to update the account_sid, auth_token, and from_ phone number with values from your Twilio account. The to phone number can be your own mobile phone.
```
from twilio.rest import Client

# Your Account SID from twilio.com/console
account_sid = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
# Your Auth Token from twilio.com/console
auth_token  = "your_auth_token"

client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

message = client.messages.create(
    to="+15558675309", 
    from_="+15017250604",
    body="Hello from Python!")

print(message.sid)
```

## Considerations

- Since this webpages are constantly updating structures on their JSON data you might want to check with a JSON viewer the dictionaries to use the correct ones specially on https://www.alphavantage.co/ and https://newsapi.org/
- You can always update the code to get more than the top 3 news and edit the slice up to how many you want about the stock price of a certain company, which in this code Tesla is set as the default company
